Title - Alcohol and Alter Boys

-- Lyrics --

There's a voice in my head telling me why I should hate you,
But I hate myself instead.
There's a pair of dead eyes in the mirror looking back at me.
I guess it's wrong to live life so lifelessly.

Scars are tearing open along my palms and knees.
I guess that's what I should get for crawling back at your feet.
And now I'm feeling so down, that there's no God above.
No mercy for a soul that's just way too fucked up.

There's a pain in my chest growing stronger with every heartbeat.
Now there's nothing left of me,
but empty bottles of pills and Bacardi.
Yes, I guess it's wrong to live right.

Leave me here to die
