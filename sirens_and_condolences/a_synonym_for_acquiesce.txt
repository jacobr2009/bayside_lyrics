Title - A Synonym For Acquiesce

-- Lyrics --

Empty fields move me so much more than rooms filled up with friends.
The way the trees look dead remind me that there's more to life than living.
Maybe giving up is not bad, but part of letting go of you.

If I surrender to this feeling maybe all the aches and pains can go and I can close my eyes
never again to have them open until I bleed out all I've been.
But I don't want to be alone no more.

Take this razor sign your name across my wrist
so everyone will know who left me like this.
Sew me up, my scars run deep
A reminder not to forget the times that we've had.

I'll never waste another second. 
I have wasted so much time.
