Title - Talking of Michelangelo

-- Lyrics --

The sidewalk's cracked and dirty face
is looking up from underneath my feet.
It's staring at the hallow broken boy
who's lost and wandering these city streets.
And every night I wander here alone,
a night that we won't meet.

I wonder when.. when I'll finally understand
why time can wash away love like it was made of sand
and it's wonderful, the pain that comes with regret.
Sometimes you have to see the beauty in all of this loneliness.

The streetlights flicker and they fade,
Like every good intention that I've had
and every face that passes through my mind.
And I'll be struggling with these same old dreams
until the concrete turns to sand and I'm swept up by the waves.

There's only so many chances that you get to do
aomething that's this important.
Now I'd rather sink than swim.
Sewer grates keep spitting up their steam
exhaling all the broken dreams I've flushed away.

And I wonder when, when I'll bow out.
Wash me away like I was made of sand,
and it's wonderful, it's wonderful.
