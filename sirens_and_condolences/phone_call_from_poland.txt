Title - Phone Call From Poland

-- Lyrics --

Well today's the 15th and you know what that means.
Time to sit and go through boxes of old pictures.
See if I can bring myself to the brink of giving up.
I never follow through, you tell me all the time.

Spend my days looking back and I wonder if you're looking up,
from underneath someone who is able to be everything that I'm not.

I'm visiting that grave and the epitaph has already been chiseled in my mind.
I'm breaking it all down right now
the way I should have let you go
and let you ruin one life instead of two.

I'll spend tonight by myself.
For the first time I'll try to look ahead
and find something that isn't doomed like we were.
Now all I need is a second chance.
