Title - Masterpiece

-- Lyrics --

My friend, 
you're always the last one to leave those dimly lit rooms.
Making sure the last glass makes its way to the table empty
and every bottle in the place
has been upside down at least a few times what a waste.
Is this what's left of you these days?

You're not eighteen anymore.
Five years should have been enough time 
for you to grow up and get over this.
It's not too cool to be throwing up all morning sick 
from what you might have done or done it with.

I swear, if I could take your pain and frame it 
and hang it on my wall,
maybe you would never have to hurt at all.
I'm painting pictures in red and blue.
A portrait bruised just like you.
Now you're walking away.

When is enough finally enough?
All the hang-ups and the heartbreaks get you past
all failures and bad breaks just accept yourself.
Find something that brings you closer to complete.
