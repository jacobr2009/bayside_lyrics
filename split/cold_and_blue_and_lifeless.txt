Title - Cold And Blue And Lifeless

-- Lyrics --

Do you know that every night I think of ways to get back at you?
I'd sneak into your room. 
Put a pillow over your face to suffocate you.
And rip into your chest to tear out your heart.

To see if you bleed like I do.
I bet you do.

Tripping over my words and now you're tripping on me. 
Isn't that funny?
Couldn't you just laugh until you choke?
I wish you would so your face could match your eyes. 
Cold and blue and lifeless.
How did I ever fall for you?

Do you know that every night I think of ways that I can spite you?
Call me when you're dead and can finally live with yourself.
Consider this a favor...consider this.
