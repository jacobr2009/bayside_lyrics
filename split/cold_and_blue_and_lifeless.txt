Title - Cold And Blue And Lifeless

-- Lyrics --

Do you know that every night I think of ways to get back at you?
I'd sneak into your room, put a pillow over your face, suffocate you.
Rip into your chest and tear out your heart.

To see if you bleed, like I do.
I bet you do.
Tripping over my words and now you're tripping on me. Isn't that funny?
Couldn't you just laugh until you choke?
I wish you would, and your face could match your eyes. Cold and blue and lifeless.
How did I ever fall for you?

Do you know that every night I think of ways that I can spite you?
Call me when you're dead or you can finally live with yourself.
Consider this a favor...consider this.

Tripping over my words and now you're tripping on me. Isn't that funny?
Couldn't you just laugh until you choke?
I wish you would, so your face could match your eyes. Cold and blue and lifeless.
How did I ever fall for you?

To see if you bleed like I do.
Tripping over my words and now you're tripping on me.
Isn't that funny?
Couldn't you just laugh until you choke?
I wish you would, so your face could match your eyes, cold and blue and lifeless.
How did I ever fall for you?

Tripping over my words and now you're tripping on me. Isn't that funny?
Couldn't you just laugh until you choke?
I wish you would, so your face could match your eyes. Cold and blue and lifeless.
How did I ever fall for you?
