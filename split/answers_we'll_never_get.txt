Title - Answers We'll Never Get

-- Lyrics --

I wonder if I said the right things.
Would this wound have bled so much?
Words are all that we have left for us.

I wonder why you had to be in such a rush.
I'll march into my graveyard and bury you now.
I'm the last man standing but not the last one laughing.
While worms eat your body and the fog covers your grave.
I'll still be trying to get your laugh out of my head.

I just need some more, just need some more time.
It's not how we should say goodbye.

Wasted my time when I thought you were stronger than ones before.
When I said that I needed some time I didn't expect you to quit.
Now that I lost you I feel like I lost myself.
And I found regret.

Answers we'll never get.
