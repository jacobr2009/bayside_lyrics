Title - Answers We'll Never Get

-- Lyrics --

I wonder
If I said the right things
Would this wound have bled so much
Words are all that we have left for us

I wonder
Why you had to be in such a rush
I'll march into my graveyard and bury you now
The last man standing
But not the last one laughing
While worms eat your body and the fog covers your grave
I'll still be trying
To get your laugh out of my head

I just need some more
Just need some more time
It's not how we should say goodbye
Wasted my time

And I thought you were stronger than ones before
When I said that I needed some time
I didn't expect you to quit
Now that I lost you
Feels like I lost myself
I found regret
