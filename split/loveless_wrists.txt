Title - Loveless Wrists

-- Lyrics --

Where will I be
When there's pain as far as eyes can see
I'll stand in line for days and nights, for making up lost time
And this is how it feels

So now I cut these loveless wrists
My head sure hurts today I'll take another twenty pills and try to make my troubles go away

So now I cut these loveless wrists
My head sure hurts today I'll take another twenty pills and try to make my troubles go away
Away

I once felt strong
It wouldn't last for long
I wrap my hands around my neck
Kill myself again
Cut my arms with the biggest knife that I can stand

Why waste time
Lifting my head
Keep it down
And save face instead
Why waste time
Lifting my head
Keep it down
Save face instead

I once felt strong
It wouldn't last for long
I wrap my hands around my neck
Kill myself again
Cut my arms with the biggest knife that I can stand

It's more than I can stand
