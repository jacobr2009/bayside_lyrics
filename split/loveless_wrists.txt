Title - Loveless Wrists

-- Lyrics --

Where will I be?
When there's pain as far as eyes can see?
I'll stand in line for days and nights for making up lost time.
And this is how it feels.

So now I'll cut these loveless wrists.
'Cuz my head sure hurts today. 
I'll take another 20 pills and try to make my troubles go away.

I once felt strong,
But it wouldn't last for long.
I'd wrap my hands around my neck
and kill myself again.
Cut my arms with the biggest knife that I can stand.

Why waste time lifting my head?
I'll keep it down and save face instead.

It's more than I can stand.
