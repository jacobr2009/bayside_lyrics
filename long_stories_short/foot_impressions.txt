So I'll leave you
To enjoy the days you spend without me
So wish in your hand
And I'll shit in mine
And I bet you mine fills up first

Words seem to roll right off your tongue
You articulate such perfect sentences and make a masterpiece of ending my life
So clever with your let downs as you fill the air with lies
So I'll sit alone and wonder what is really going on (behind) beyond your eyes

I'll circle your house for days and hope that you come to meet me
So many foot impressions form a moat
And you'll see how deep my feelings are for you
And you still won't care

So I'll leave you
To enjoy the days you spend without me
So let's hold hands
And be the best of friends
And I know I'll never feel this way again
