I've spent too much time
Picking up pieces I've left behind
For months you've been mine
Still doesn't make it alright

I fell deaf to everything you said
I didn't mean to but you ask for it
I meant everything I said
We're through now cause you bring me down

Don't be the one
Waiting at my door next time I hear a knock
It won't be the same
The way it used to be so please leave me alone
