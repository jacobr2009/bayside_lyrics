Title - Advance Letter Goodbye

-- Lyrics --

Begin my downfall
Cause I met another person
And this time she says that she likes me
And I like her eyes
So in advance for when I fail I wanna say I’m sorry

Pictures
Without pictures of you
My wallet has never looked so empty before

I want to rub between your thighs
And blow kisses right between your eyes
And take you places that you’ve never been to

You’re way too good for me
Cause I’m cursed with years of failure
And I know I’m bound to bring you down
I guess it’s plain to see
I’m cursed with shredded genes
And shoes too big for my feet

You’ll forget the boy you left behind
And forget you ever made him cry
You won’t care you lost your biggest fan
