Title - Days Of My Life

-- Lyrics --

Took some time to think my whole life through
Cause nine to five's not cutting it and I've got more important things to do
Than sit around like apples slowly rotting to their cores
And I won't take it cause I know that I'm here for so much more

Remind me of all I am and all I have to give
Deny me the right to lead a life that's meaningless

My words are true
I'll see the world and have more fun than you
My stories told
Will be ones of adventure with girls involved
Stories untold
The streets outside New York are paved in gold

The days of my life aren't so stupid anymore
So I guess I'll see you on the road
