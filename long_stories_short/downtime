Come down now
Strut your stuff
I worry about you
It's ok
If you don't care
Now I'm down and I wish you were here

Wish you were here, wish you were...

You need some, some downtime
I'm sorry if you're so unhappy
I'm dying without you
Be happy cause you know I care

And you're a queen
Surpass the things I've seen
I'm dying without you
Call me sometime

Sorry that
You failed
To fuck up my life like you fucked up theirs
I'm trying
To tell you all of the things that I meant to that day

Meant to that day, wish I could...

Cheer up my, my old friend
Cuz I offer interest in you
